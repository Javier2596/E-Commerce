# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

For this challenge I was assigned to create the back end for the e-commerce website using Sequelize, API routes, Models, Seeds file, and an env file. The motivation for completing this challenge was to better my skills in backend web development. I build this project to create a back end for a retail website; the problems this challenge solves are providing the retail company a back end database for their website that there employees can access. It allows employees to find products in their inventory, add new products, delete products. It also allows them to check the products price, availability, and IDs. This assignment is not yet complete since I have to test the get, post, put, delete in insomnia.
